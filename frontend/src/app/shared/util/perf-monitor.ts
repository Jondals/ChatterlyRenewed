/**
 * src/app/shared/util/perf-monitor.ts
 * Watches how smoothly the page is drawn and, on a device that cannot keep up, switches the whole interface to the
 * light mode (`data-perf="low"`): no blur, fewer and slower lights, decorative animations paused.
 *
 * ? Why it exists: the animated backgrounds, auras and lights look great on a good computer and make a weak one stutter.
 * The light mode already existed, but it only switched on when the sign-in introduction was slow, so a person who
 * never saw it kept the heavy effects. Measuring the real frames of the real page is the only reliable way to know.
 *
 * * How it decides: for a minute after the start it counts the frames of every 3-second window. A window where more than a
 * third of the frames took longer than 34 ms (under 30 frames per second) is a "slow window"; two of them in a row switch
 * the light mode on for the rest of the visit. Frames after the tab was hidden or frozen (a gap over half a second) are
 * ignored, so changing tab never counts as lag. A good device pays almost nothing: one tiny callback per frame, for a
 * minute, outside Angular.
